Papers exploring quantum computing applications in chemistry and biology

Background

I have started to work on quantum computing application for chemisrty and biology in 2019 and was the co-founder of a startup called Menten AI. I always wanted to have a collection of papers which uses the early stage NISQ era machines for chemical or biological applications. We hope that this will be a useful resource for people interested in the field and want to keep up with the rapid development.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public, collaborative list of applied quantume computing papers for chemistry and biology. If you have suggestions for other papers or categories, please make a pull request or issue!

Format

Within each category, papers are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first). Where possible, a link should be provided.
